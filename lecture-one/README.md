#### Running the SimpleServer/SimpleClient example

These were written and very poorly tested on Java 1.8.

You'll need two shells open, one for the `SimpleServer` and one for the `SimpleClient`.

In the first shell, compile then run the `SimpleServer`:
```
> javac SimpleServer.java
> java SimpleServer
```

In the second shell, compile then run the `SimpleClient`:
```
> javac SimpleClient.java
> java SimpleClient
```

Gaze in awe at client/server communication.  Then kill the server with Ctrl-C.
